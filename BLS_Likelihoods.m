% BLS_LIKELIHOODS  Convenience function to encapsulate likelihood types
% 
% LIKELIHOOD = BLS_LIKELIHOODS(TYPE)
% 
% OUTPUT ARGUMENTS:
% 
%	LIKELIHOOD	A structure containing an enumeration of possible
%				likelihood types, and specification of the type in use.
% 
% INPUT ARGUMENTS:
% 
%	TYPE		A string. One of:
%					'Gaussian'
%					'Bernoulli'
%					'Poisson'
% 
% EXAMPLE:
%
%	LIKELIHOOD	= BLS_Likelihoods('Gaussian');
