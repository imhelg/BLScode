% TOLERANCES
% 
% Any Q^2-S "relevance factor" less than this is considered to be zero

% ADD/DELETE
% 
% - preferring addition where possible will probably make the algorithm a
% little slower and perhaps less "greedy"
% 
% - preferring deletion may make the model a little more sparse and the
% algorithm may run slightly quicker
% 
% Note: both these can be set to 'true' at the same time, in which case
% both take equal priority over re-estimation.

% (GAUSSIAN) NOISE
%
% When to update the noise estimate
%
% The number of iterations from the start for which we update it every
% iteration (to get in the right ball-park to begin with)
% 
CONTROLS.BetaUpdateStart		= 10;
%
% After the above, we only regularly update it after 
% a given number of iterations
%

%
% Prevent zero-noise estimate (perfect fit) problem
% -	effectively says the noise variance estimate is clamped to be no
%	lower than variance-of-targets / BetaMaxFactor.
