% BLS_PREPROCESSBASIS  Do basis matrix pre-processing for BLS
%
% [BASIS, SCALES] = BLS_PREPROCESSBASIS(BASIS)
%
% OUTPUT ARGUMENTS:
%
%	BASIS	NxM matrix of basis vectors appropriately pre-processed
%			(scaled to unit length per column) 
% 
%	SCALES	Vector of scaling factors applied
%
% 
% INPUT ARGUMENTS:
% 
%	BASIS	NxM matrix of basis vectors (one column per basis function)
%
% NOTES: 
% 
% Simply normalises the basis vectors to unit length, returning the
% original lengths so that the weights can be rescaled appropriately
% before returning to the user.
